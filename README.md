# Hi, I'm Ruminyam

I'm a frontend engineer based in Japan, passionate about **technical exploration and continuous improvement**.

I enjoy refining development workflows, designing UI architecture, and building tools that reduce friction for engineers.  
I believe in the value of **small iterations**, **clear abstractions**, and **developer-friendly ecosystems**.

- Building developer tools (e.g. GitHub Actions, CLI tools)
- SSR apps with Hono + React
